                        <p>
                            An unsecured business loan is a type of loan that does not require the borrower to
                            provide any collateral, such as property or other assets, to secure the loan. <br />
                            Instead, the loan is granted based on the borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness, business performance,
                            and financial history.

                        <p>
                            A secured business loan is a type of loan where the borrower pledges an asset
                            (called collateral) to the lender as security for the loan. <br />
                            If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender has the legal right to
                            seize and sell the collateral to recover the outstanding amount.
